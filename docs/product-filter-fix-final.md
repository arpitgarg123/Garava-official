# Product Filter Fix - Final Report

## Date: October 14, 2025

## Issue Reported
**User:** "earing and ring both are coming on the same section"

## Root Cause
During the initial categorization fix, the script incorrectly categorized earring products as "rings" because it only checked for the word "ring" in the product name. Since earring names contain "ring" (ea**ring**), they were all misclassified.

## Fix Applied

### Step 1: Identified Misclassified Products
Found 7 earring products incorrectly categorized as "rings":

1. Celestial Round Solitaire Earrings
2. Elegant Princess cut Solitaire Earrings
3. Opulent Emerald cut Solitaire Earrings
4. Graceful Pear Solitaire Earrings
5. Charming Classic Oval Solitaire Earrings
6. Brilliant Round Diamond Earrings with Diamond Halo
7. Brilliant Round Diamond Earrings with Halo

### Step 2: Corrected Categories
Updated all 7 products: `category: "rings"` ‚Üí `category: "earrings"` ‚úÖ
