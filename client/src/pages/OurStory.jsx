            <p className='mt-2'>Of those who rise not by privilege—but by purpose.
Of those who uplift others before they adorn themselves.
Of those whose worth is earned, never inherited.

</p>
<br />
<p>Born out of a desire to overcome with wasteful luxury and hollow prestige,
GARAVA redefines what it means to be exceptional.
We do not create for the few who flaunt wealth.
We create for the few who build wealth—for others, for the world, for the future.
